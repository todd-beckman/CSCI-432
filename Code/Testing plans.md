#Testing A* vs D* Lite

##Tests
* Static, known maps as control
* Changing maps
* Unknown maps
* Highly changing, very unknown map
* Sparse vs dense.

* Lets do some big-ass maps. 3000+x3000+

* Compare memory costs.
* Practicality for realtime planning.

* Maze-like paths vs. realistic, smooth, paths.

* Compare actual running times, but don't go too in depth, not precise metric.

* Compare vertices visited, priority queue pushes and pops.
